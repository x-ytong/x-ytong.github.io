<div align="center"><h1>Global High Categorical Resolution Land Cover Mapping<br> via Weak Supervision</h1></div>

<p style="text-align: center">Xin-Yi Tong, Runmin Dong, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Land cover information is essential for achieving the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, and land cover mapping under a more detailed 
category system would significantly contribute to economic livelihood tracking and environmental degradation measurement. However, the substantial 
difficulty in acquiring fine-grained training data makes the implementation of this task particularly challenging. Here, we propose to combine fully 
labeled source domain and weakly labeled target domain for weakly supervised domain adaptation (WSDA). This is beneficial as the utilization of sparse 
and coarse weak labels can considerably alleviate the labor required for precise and detailed land cover annotation. Specifically, we introduce the 
Prototype-based pseudo-label Rectification and Expansion (<b>PRE</b>) approach, which leverages the prototypes as the bridge to connect sparse labels 
and global feature distributions. According to the feature distances to the prototypes, the confidence of pseudo-labels predicted in the unlabeled 
regions of the target domain is assessed. This confidence is then utilized to guide the dynamic expansion and rectification of pseudo-labels. Based on 
PRE, we carry out high categorical resolution land cover mapping for 10 cities in different regions around the world, severally using PlanetScope (PS), 
Gaofen-1 (GF-1), and Sentinel-2 (ST-2) satellite images. In the study areas, we achieve <b>cross-sensor</b>, <b>cross-category</b>, and 
<b>cross-continent</b> WSDA, with the overall accuracy exceeding 80%. The promising results indicate that PRE is capable of reducing the dependency of 
land cover classification on high-quality annotations, thereby supporting "data minimization" in a cost-effective manner. We expect our work to enable 
global fine-grained land cover mapping which in turn promote Earth observation to provide more precise and thorough information for environmental 
monitoring.</p>

<h3>Study Area and Data</h3>
<p>we construct a weakly supervised land cover classification dataset, comprising two parts: C-megacities and G-cities, which are globally distributed 
and feature-rich in information with fine-grained weak labels. It encompasses various satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from <b>3 m</b> 
to <b>10 m</b>. Using it as the target domain and combining with the source domain, i.e., the 
<a href="https://x-ytong.github.io/project/Five-Billion-Pixels.html"><b>Five-Billion-Pixels</b></a> dataset, we implement land cover mapping for 10 
cities located globally via WSDA.</p>

  G-cities and the source domain, there exists cross-sensor, cross-category, and cross-continent challenges.</p>

<h3>Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation</h3>
<p>The objective of the WSDA task is to train a semantic segmentation model using fully annotated source data and weakly annotated target data, 
ensuring effective adaptation of the model to the target domain. we propose PRE to link labeled and unlabeled regions in the target domain utilizing 
the prototypes. Concretely, in addition to using labeled regions from the source and target domains to assess the domain joint segmentation loss, we 
introduce a dynamic pseudo-label self-training loss and a dynamic pseudo-label self-rectification loss. A subset of the most reliable pseudo-labels 
is used to compute the self-training loss. The remaining ones are rectified based on the feature distances, and the degree of modification is used to 
calculate the self-rectification loss. With each iteration, the pseudo-labels are dynamically expanded, and the prototypes are dynamically updated. </p>

<h3>Land Cover Mapping</h3>
<p>We creat land cover mapping results for G-cities, which are mosaicked from 101 PS images. Among them, 30 images have weak annotations used for model 
training, 10 images have annotations for testing but not involved in training, and the remaining 71 images having no annotations at all. To ensure the 
completeness of visual presentation, these 30 training images are not removed during mapping. Therefore, these results are presented for illustrative 
purposes only.</p>
